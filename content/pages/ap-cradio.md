# Testbed overview

The Cognitive Radio part of the LOG-a-TEC testbed consists of several clusters of permanently mounted VESNA sensor nodes that are dedicated to experimentation with spectrum sensing and radio communications within wireless sensor networks. Each sensor node in these clusters is equipped with multiple reconfigurable radio interfaces that can be used in various modes. A license from the local regulator allows for experimentation in TV whitespaces as well as frequency bands for unlicensed devices.

Testbed is remotely accessible over the Internet and uses a dedicated, wireless management network to control individual sensor nodes in a cluster. Different approaches can be used to perform experiments, depending on the latency requirements and complexity of experimental scenarios: from high-level control using Python or graphical network stack composition to reprogramming the nodes with native applications. Radio propagation modeling tools can be used as well to plan the experiments.

In addition to permanently mounted nodes, several kinds of mobile nodes or instruments can be added to the testbed in special cases and after previous agreement.

## Locations

Cognitive Radio part of LOG-a-TEC testbed consists of the following permanently mounted clusters:

### JSI campus

There is 79 sensor nodes mounted at the campus of the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia. They cover approximately 3000 m2 of in-door and out-door space and are placed on light poles 3.5 m above the ground and on the surrounding buildings at heights from 2.0 to 9.3 m. To enable experiments in indoor as well as in mixed indoor/outdoor scenarios, the testbed is extended in an indoor environment with additional 20 UWB devices and one LPWA device. These are deployed on the second and third floors of the 28.4 m by 16.6 m building.

<!-- TODO get a better picture of devices in the testbed? -->

Architecturally, we consider hybrid testbed devices with two separate functional blocks represented by the [infrastructure node](hw-lgtc.html) and the [target node](hw-vesna.html). Therefore, a generic infrastructure node that can be combined with various target nodes. The infrastructure node is a custom designed single board computer based on the BeagleCore module running the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. The target node is a custom VESNA (VErsatile platform for Sensor Network Applications) device with an ARM Cortex-M3 micro controller application module and dedicated experimentation transceivers. As seen in the table above, devices are equipped with different wireless radio technology - you can read more about them in the [hardware section](hw-vesna.html).

Infrastructure nodes use 5GHz WiFi to avoid interference with experimental network and they are directly accessible from the Internet using IPv6. With server, which acts like a controller, we can automate various experiments and test different protocols. Nodes at IJS campus are running [Contiki-NG](cr-software.html), a small open source operating system for resource-constrained devices which is great for developing and testing IPv6 wireless communications.

Cluster is currently used for experiments with packet-based transmissions and background noise measurements in wireless sensor networks. For more details, please continue at example [6LoWPAN network statistics](ex-6lowpan.html).

### Logatec city

Logatec is a small city with approximately 10.000 inhabitants in the south-west of Slovenia. Three sensor node clusters cover approximately 350.000 m<sup>2</sup> of out-door public space in the city center and an industrial zone using a total of 52 sensor nodes on street lights and other public infrastructure:

 * Logatec industrial zone, street level cluster (24 nodes)
 * Logatec city centre, street level cluster (27 nodes)
 * Logatec city centre, antenna tower sensor (1 node)

<img alt="Map with sensor node locations in Logatec" src="img/Logatec-clusters.png"><img alt="Sensor node mounted on a street light" src="img/UHFpole.png">

These clusters are currently used for spectrum sensing experiments and radio environment mapping. Three distinct hardware node configurations are deployed:

 * nodes with CC1101 and AT86RF212 radios (transmission and sensing in UHF and 868 MHz band, blue on map),
 * nodes with CC2500 and AT86RF212 radios (transmission and sensing in 2.4 GHz band, red on map) and
 * nodes with SNE-ISMTV-UHF and AT86RF212 radios (sensing in UHF band, green on map).

Nodes in the cluster are running the vesna-drivers firmware and use a dedicated, low-speed IEEE 802.15.4 management network (independent of the experimental radio hardware) for control and reprogramming. Each node is accessible from the Internet using a REST API and an application protocol similar to HTTP ([ALH](cr-software.html)).

Additionally, a small number of software-defined radio nodes using the Ettus Reseach USRP N200 can be used in the test bed as needed. A Rohde & Schwarz SMBV100A vector signal generator and a FSV signal analyzer are available for on-site measurements.

## Software

The following is a list of the major software components of the LOG-a-TEC testbed.

### Node firmware

 * *vesna-drivers* is a custom developed C library for developing node firmware images. It supports experiment control and data retrieval over an application protocol similar to HTTP (ALH). Typical application developed with vesna-drivers supports signal generation and energy detection.
 * [Contiki-NG](https://www.contiki-ng.org/) is an operating system for resource-constrained devices in the Internet of Things. With the help of vesna-drivers, it is a perfect tool for experimentation with IPv6 wireless sensor networks.
 * [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org/) is an open source embedded operating system with cooperative multi-tasking. In LOG-a-TEC testbeds it has been extended to support two networking stacks in parallel and a composeable RIME stack. It is typically used for experimentation with packet-based transmissions in wireless sensor networks.
 * [vesna-spectrum-sensor](https://github.com/sensorlab/vesna-spectrum-sensor) is an open source spectrum sensing application for spectrum sensing using VESNA sensor nodes. It is typically used when measurements with a mobile sensor node are performed in the testbed. It uses a wired RS-232 connection with a PC to report measurements.

### Experiment support

 * A [LOG-a-TEC web portal](https://crn.log-a-tec.eu/) provides an overview the testbed, its current state and allows for manual interaction with sensor nodes using a REST API requests. It also provides a graphical interface to the radio planning tools.
 * [vesna-alh-tools](https://github.com/sensorlab/vesna-alh-tools) is a library and a collection of tools that allow for interaction with the testbed and experiment control from the Python language. [vesna-alh-js](https://github.com/sensorlab/vesna-alh-js) is a similar, although less developed library, using Javascript.
 * [ProtoStack](https://github.com/sensorlab/ProtoStack) is a graphical tool for network stack development. It can be used to experiment with dynamic composition of communication services in the Contiki OS.
 * [GRASS-RaPlaT](http://www-e6.ijs.si/RaPlaT/GRASS-RaPlaT_main_page.htm) is an open-source radio planning tool. It contains a number of channel models that can be used to calculate radio coverage of a single node or a whole network. Integration with the LOG-a-TEC testbed provides raster maps of the area surrounding the testbed and can be used, for example, to predict received signal strengths for radio links in an experiment.
 * [URLs, URNs and RSpecs](cr-etel-rspecs.html) used for integration with Fed4FIRE.
