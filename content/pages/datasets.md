## Dataset: ws_traffic_20170606

A dataset containing 24 hours of continuous spectrum measurements. A proprietary spectrum sensing device placed on top of a building in a mid-sized European city recorded 5 PSD measurements per second using 1024 FFT bins in a 192 kHz wide band inside the unlicensed European 868 MHz SRD band.

Data are stored in *JSONL* format with an object on each line having the following properties: `Time` (ISO 8691 datetime format, *yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.ffffff*) and `Measurements` (array of power measurements in dBm).

Provided are also transmission labels from two experts, 4 sets with various `noise_cutoff` thresholds per expert. For more information on these files see the labeling tool's documentation below.
